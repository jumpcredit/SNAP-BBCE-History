# SNAP BBCE History

State broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE) changes from 2010-2023

## What is BBCE?

SNAP eligibility rules are set at a federal level, with two of the income requirements being:

- A gross income limit set at 130% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) 
- An asset limit of $2,750 (also known as the resource limit)

Households that include a member who is 60 or older or has a disability don't have to meet the gross income limit and have a higher asset limit. There is also a net income limit which under federal rules all households must meet.

Broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE) is a policy that allows states to set their own income and asset limits for SNAP. If a state has a BBCE policy, they can add an alternative path to SNAP eligibility with increased gross income limits and increased or removed asset limits.

Here's the [USDA's definition:](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/broad-based-categorical-eligibility)

> Broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE) is a policy in which households may become categorically eligible for SNAP because they qualify for a non-cash Temporary Assistance for  Needy Families (TANF) or State maintenance of effort (MOE) funded benefit ... BBCE cannot limit eligibility. Households that are not eligible for the program that confers categorical eligibility may apply for and receive SNAP under regular program rules. Under regular program rules, SNAP households with elderly or disabled members do not need to meet the gross income limit, but must meet the net income limit.

States can increase the gross income limit for SNAP up to 200% FPL. This analysis looks at how states have changed their income limits over time.

- Arizona had a few months increase from 185% to 200% in 2012
- Florida had a few months decrease from 200% to 130% in 2013
- Louisiana removed BBCE in 2014, added back in 2020
